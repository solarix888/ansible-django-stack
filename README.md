ansible-django-stack
====================

Ansible Playbook designed for environments running a Django app.  It can install and configure these applications that are commonly used in production Django deployments:
- Nginx
- Gunicorn
- MySQL
- Supervisor
- Virtualenv
- Memcached
- Celery
- RabbitMQ

Default settings are stored in ```roles/role_name/vars/main.yml```.  Environment-specific settings are in the ```env_vars``` directory.

**Tested with OS:** Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS x64

**Tested with Cloud Providers:** Amazon, Rackspace, Digital Ocean

## Getting Started
A quick way to get started is with Vagrant and VirtualBox.

### Requirements
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

The main settings to change here is in the **env_vars/base** file, where you can configure the location of your Git project, the project name, and application name which will be used throughout the Ansible configuration.

```
vagrant up
```

Wait a few minutes for the magic to happen.  Access the app by going to this URL: http://192.168.33.15

Yup, exactly, you just provisioned a completely new server and deployed an entire Django stack in 5 minutes with _two words_ :).

### Additional vagrant commands
**SSH to the box**
```
vagrant ssh
```

**Re-provision the box to apply the changes you made to the Ansible configuration**
```
vagrant provision
```

**Reboot the box**
```
vagrant reload
```

**Shutdown the box**
```
vagrant halt
```

## Running the Ansible Playbook on existing servers
Create a Playbook for that environment and specify the user accounts to use. See **development.yml** for an example.

If you only have 1 server, you can skip the other steps below and simply run the Playbook with this command:

```
ansible-playbook -i server_ip_address_or_hostname, -v playbook.yml --ask-sudo-pass
```

If you have multiple servers, create an inventory file in the root folder for your environment and add your servers' hostnames or IP addresses there.

For example:

```
# development

[webservers]
webserver1.example.com
webserver2.example.com

[dbservers]
dbserver1.example.com
```

Run the Playbook:

```
ansible-playbook -i development -v development.yml --ask-sudo-pass
```

If you're testing with vagrant, you can use this command:

```
ansible-playbook -i vagrant_ansible_inventory_default --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -v vagrant.yml
```

## Advanced Options

### Creating a swap file

By default, the playbook won't create a swap file.  To create/enable swap, simply change the values in `roles/base/vars/main.yml`. 

You can also override these values in the main playbook, for example:

```
---

- name: Create a {{ application_name }} virtual machine via vagrant
  hosts: all
  sudo: yes
  sudo_user: root
  remote_user: vagrant
  vars:
    - setup_git_repo: yes
    - update_apt_cache: yes
  vars_files:
    - env_vars/base.yml
    - env_vars/local.yml

  roles:
    - { role: base, create_swap_file: yes, swap_file_size_kb: 1024 }
    - db
    - web
    - memcached
```

This will create and mount a 1GB swap.  Note that block size is 1024, so the size of the swap file will be 1024 x `swap_file_size_kb`.
